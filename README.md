# Artificial Intelligence Powered UAV Tracking System

## Overview

This project is an advanced UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking system powered by Artificial Intelligence. The system is designed to provide real-time tracking and monitoring of UAVs, utilizing state-of-the-art AI algorithms to ensure precise and efficient tracking performance.

## Features

- **Real-time UAV Tracking:** Continuously monitors and tracks UAVs with high accuracy.
- **AI-Powered Algorithms:** Utilizes machine learning models for detecting and tracking UAVs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor UAVs.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle multiple UAVs simultaneously.

## Installation

To get started with the UAV Tracking System, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aeminklbsr/Artificial-Intelligence-Powered-UAV-Tracking-System.git
   cd Artificial-Intelligence-Powered-UAV-Tracking-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
